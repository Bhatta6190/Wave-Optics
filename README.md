# Wave Optics

This repository hosts resources compiled as a part of graduate level wave optics course assignnments. Each directory focuses on a specific task related to wave optics simulations and analysis and includes all necessary resources including requirements for assignments and solutions.

### Available Resources:
- **`Beam-Propagation-Method`**: Contains the implementation of tasks related to the `Beam Propagation Method (BPM)`.

- **`Intereference-of-Spherical-waves`**: Contains resources for simulating and analyzing the `interference of spherical waves` emitted by multiple sources.

- **`4f-Phase-Contrast-Optical-System`**: Contains Analytical and numerical implementations of a `4f phase contrast optical system`.

- **`Irradiance-PSF-and-MTF`**: Contains numerical implementations for the analysis of `irradiance`, `Point Spread Function (PSF)`, and `Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)` in optical systems.
