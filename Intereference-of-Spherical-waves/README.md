# Exact Interference of Spherical Waves

This directory contains code, tasks, and observations for simulating and analyzing the interference of spherical waves emitted by multiple sources as a part of graduate level optics course. The work explores how wave patterns form and evolve under different configurations and distances.

## Features
- **Wave Interference Simulation**: Models interference patterns for multiple spherical wave sources.
- **Configurable Source Arrangements**:
  - Circular arrangements with adjustable radial separation.
  - Linear arrangements with varying separation distances.
- **Visualization Outputs**:
  - Amplitude ($\|E(x, y, z)| \$) and phase ($\ Î¦(x, y, z) \$) plots.
  - Plots for near-field, intermediate, and far-field distances.
- **Pattern Analysis**:
  - Differences between central and outer regions of irradiance plots.
  - Effect of source separation on pattern compactness.
  - Far-field approximations using plane waves.

## Content
- **Code**: Python scripts to compute and render interference patterns is included in `Interference_Spherical_Waves.ipynb` jupyter notebook file.
- **Tasks**: Detailed problem statements for various configurations and scenarios are provided in `Interference_Spherical_Waves_Tasks.pdf` file..
